# KCproject
 IS 117 final project / web portfolio

TO DO (in order of importance):

- populate the works page with The Cards&trade;
- figure out why the dark theme doesn't work on the works page (maybe because ALL the file paths are different....????)
- throw together a plain text version of my resume so people can read it on mobile devices
- make sure the contact form works
- get that damn toggle thing to work properly
