# KCproject
 IS 117 final project / web portfolio

Progress Report:
1. Home: 90% - Need to write proper bio and fix something weird with the carousel
2. Works: 95% - Looks good, but still needs the animation. Not an immediate concern though, the important thing is that everything *works*.
3. Resume: 33% - Need to redo as plain text
4. Contact: 90% - need to test and see if it actually works

TO DO (in order of importance):

- ~~populate the works page with The Cards&trade;~~ done!
- write a plain text version of my resume so people can read it on mobile devices
- make sure the contact form actually works
- write a real damn bio
- get that fucking theme toggle switch to STAY toggled every time
